\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}
In this project we have tried to create an implementation of the "Trajectory Planning" task which is one of the core concepts in the robotics theory and practice. The implementation is heavily relied on the Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control book~\parencite{robotics_book}.  

\section{Mindmap of the documentation}
We decided to divide the documentation into 3 parts. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Theoretical basis} - mathematical foundation of the project
    \item \textbf{User documentation} - how to use program with the Franka robot
    \item  \textbf{Developer documentation} - core ideas and implementation details 
    \item \textbf{Conclusion} - results and summary
\end{enumerate}
